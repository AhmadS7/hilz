## Introduction

Retirement may seem far off, but saving early is crucial. This guide provides simple steps to plan for a secure retirement.

## Why Start Saving Early?

The power of compound interest!  The earlier you start, the more time your money has to grow.  Even small contributions can make a big difference over time.

## Retirement Savings Options

*   **401(k):**  Employer-sponsored plan, often with matching contributions.
*   **Traditional IRA:**  Tax-deductible contributions, earnings grow tax-deferred.
*   **Roth IRA:**  Contributions are not tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
*   **Other Investments:**  Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, real estate.

## How Much Should You Save?

A general rule of thumb is to save 15% of your income for retirement.  However, the exact amount depends on your individual circumstances and goals.

## Steps to Take

1.  **Estimate Your Retirement Needs:**  How much income will you need in retirement?
2.  **Choose Your Savings Vehicles:**  Select the best retirement accounts for your situation.
3.  **Automate Your Savings:**  Set up regular contributions to your retirement accounts.
4.  **Review and Adjust:**  Regularly review your plan and make adjustments as needed.

## Conclusion

Saving for retirement is a marathon, not a sprint.  Start early, be consistent, and you'll be well on your way to a comfortable retirement.
